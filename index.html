<h1 id="hello">Hi! 👋🏽</h1>

<div id="homepage-text">
<p>I’m Lucas Adelino, an educator with a passion for language and tech, and a prospective PhD student in Computational Linguistics. Welcome to my site! Please use the menu on the left to learn more about who I am and what I’ve done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> tab describes several projects I have completed. Most of them focus on natural language processing using Python (like building <a href="/projects/chapter3.html">n-gram language models</a> and <a href="/projects/chapter4.html">sentiment classifiers</a>). You can also learn more about how I created this website.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/experience/">Experience</a> tab contains information about my professional and academic experience.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/about/">About</a> tab contains information about myself and my research interests.</li>
</ul>

<p>This website is under construction, but feel free to browse around! I don't expect the overall structure of the site to change, but individual pages are being continuously updated. You can check the source code of the website <a href="https://github.com/lucasadelino/lucasadelino.github.io">here</a>.</p>
