<h1 id="hello">Hi! 👋🏽</h1>

<div id="homepage-text">
<p>I'm Lucas Adelino, a master's student in Linguistics at <a href="https://linguistics.unc.edu/"> The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>. My research program centers around computational semantics, and my current research project is on paraphrase type annotation.</p>

<p>I'm also a TA for data literacy lab (IDST 121L). My office hours are on <b>Tuesdays</b> from <b>1:00 to 3:00 p.m</b>, at <b>104 Smith</b> Building. If you can't make it to office hours, I'm also happy to meet with you over Zoom.</p>
