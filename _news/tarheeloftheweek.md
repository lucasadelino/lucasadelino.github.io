I was featured in Tar Hell of the Week, a weekly column at UNC that showcases UNC students and their research. You can read the column [here](https://college.unc.edu/college-up-close-linguistics/) (also available on Instagram [here!](https://www.instagram.com/unccollege/p/C3aaj39rp68/?img_index=1)).
