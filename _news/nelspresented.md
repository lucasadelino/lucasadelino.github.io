Dr. Smith and I just presented our poster at NELS 54. It was such a great experience to talk to and learn from so many brilliant linguists! It was also fantastic to get to know the MIT, which has such a rich history within Linguistics. Huge thanks to the folks who came by to talk to us about the poster!
