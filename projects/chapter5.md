## What it is

A logistic classifier trained on a corpus of 105,195 movie reviews in Portuguese, built by scrapping user film reviews from [Filmow](http://filmow.com) (the same corpus used in the [previous chapter]({% link projects/chapter4.md %})). 

## The setup

[Chapter 5 of Jurafsky & Martin](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/5.pdf) introduces the reader to logistic regression classifiers. The chapter uses those classifiers to teach foundational machine learning concepts like loss functions, optimization, and regularization. I devoted special attention to this chapter because it taught such important concepts; implementing this classifier was one of the ways to make sure I got everything right. 

## The process

This project is currently in development! Check back by January 17 to see the finished product. In the meantime, you can check my progress on the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lucasadelino/Learning-Compling/tree/main/Textbooks/Speech%20and%20Language%20Processing%20(Jurafsky%2C%20Martin)/Chapter%205%20-%20Logistic%20Regression).
