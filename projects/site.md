## What it is

## The setup

I created my [previous portfolio](https://lcsadelino.wixsite.com/eportfolio) using [Wix](http://wix.com/), a simple online website builder. Wix's greatest pro is also its greatest con: it is What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG). This means that anyone can build a Wix website, since you don't need to know how to code. It also means that Wix isn't as customizable, easy to update, or rich in features as non-WYSIWYG platforms. Moreover, setting up a custom domain for a Wix website requires you to sign up for their (relatively expensive) premium plan. Since I was learning more about coding, I thought I could take another shot at doing a portfolio (and use a custom domain for a fraction of the price).

Two things pushed me to use the platform that I used: 

- First, I discovered that Notion (which is what I used to write this) uses Markdown for most of its formatting. Whatever I wrote in Notion, I could copy and paste into a code editor and it would look almost exactly the same, which made writing, say, readme files in GitHub a breeze.
- Then, I found out that GitHub pages uses Jekyll. Once I realized that I could use Jekyll to easily turn my markdown files into a website, I knew that's what I would use. I already knew some (very basic) HTML and CSS, but after completing my web scraping project, I felt even more confident in playing around with it.

## The process

### Challenge #1: Learning Jekyll

### Challenge #2: Customizing the theme
