# Hello! 👋🏽
I'm a data engineer at the [public health department for the City of Recife](https://www2.recife.pe.gov.br/pagina/secretaria-de-saude). I develop and maintain
data pipelines to help track key performance indicators of Recife's public healthcare system. 

Before that, I was a teaching assistant and a master's student  in Computational Linguistics at <a href="https://linguistics.unc.edu/"> the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a>, where I researched paraphrase detection. And before *that*, I was an educator; I have over four years of experience teaching data literacy and English writing.
