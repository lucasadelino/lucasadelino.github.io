# Hello! 👋🏽
I'm a data engineer at the [public health department](https://www2.recife.pe.gov.br/pagina/secretaria-de-saude) of the [City of Recife](https://www2.recife.pe.gov.br). I build and maintain
data pipelines to help track key performance indicators of Recife's public healthcare system. 

Before that, I was a teaching assistant and a master's student in Computational Linguistics at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://linguistics.unc.edu/), where I [researched]({% post_url 2024-07-06-paraop %}) paraphrase detection. And before *that*, I was an educator: I have over four years of experience teaching data literacy and English writing.
