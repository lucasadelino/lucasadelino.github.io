# Hi! 👋🏽

This repository contains the source code of my portfolio, [lucasadelino.com](http://lucasadelino.com). The site was built using the [Chirpy theme](https://chirpy.cotes.info/) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). I made several modifications to the theme, including removing the search bar and several features of the 'post' layout.
