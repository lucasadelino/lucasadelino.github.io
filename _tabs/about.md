## Nice to meet you! üëãüèº

My name is Lucas Adelino, a data engineer and computational linguist.

## What I'm up to now
I'm a data engineer at [NGI](https://github.com/NGI-SECOGE-SESAU), which oversees business intelligence initiatives within the [public health department](https://www2.recife.pe.gov.br/pagina/secretaria-de-saude) of the [City of Recife](https://www2.recife.pe.gov.br). 

At NGI, I build and maintain data pipelines. This typically involves working with stakeholders and data analysts to understand business needs, identifying and extracting data from various sources, building transformations with [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/product/what-is-dbt), and orchestrating everything with [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). My other responsibilities include maintaining NGI's databases and an internal datahub--a website we use to document and share data with other teams at the City of Recife.

I was fortunate to join NGI shortly after its inception. Our teammates and I built our data infrastructure from the ground up, from choosing the tools for our data stack to installing and configuring them. This was an incredible opportunity, as it gave me a much deeper command of foundational data engineering tools than I might have gained otherwise.

## What I did before

I studied Computational Linguistics at [the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://linguistics.unc.edu/), graduating with a master's degree in 2024. My research was on automatic paraphrase type annotation--check out [this blog post]({% post_url 2024-07-06-paraop %}) for a brief overview. I was also a graduate teaching assistant for the [Data Literacy Lab](https://ideasinaction.unc.edu/first-year-foundations/ideas-information-and-inquiry/), a course on the basics of data analysis, including exploratory analysis in Excel, data visualization in Tableau, and statistical analysis in RStudio. I also [dabbled](https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.mit.edu/dist/2/943/files/2023/08/adelino-smith.pdf) in researching the wonderful oddities of Brazilian Portuguese. 

UNC was somewhat of a sea change for me: before, I studied education at [Auburn University](https://auburn.edu), graduating with a master's degree in 2022. During my time at Auburn, I was also a program assistant at the [University Writing](https://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/university-writing/) initiative, where I helped students build professional websites and taught workshops on English academic writing.
