# Nice to meet you! üëãüèΩ

My name is Lucas Adelino, and I'm an educator with a passion for language and technology. 

I first started college as an undergrad in Computer Science at the [Federal University of Pernambuco](https://www.ufpe.br/). I deeply enjoyed the program, but at the time, my love for writing led me to change majors Communication/Journalism. During my undergrad, I worked as a PR intern at several institutions in my hometown of [Recife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife). I graduated with a bachelor's in Journalism in 2017. 

In that same year, I was admitted into [Auburn University](auburn.edu) as a master's student in Adult Education. After my first semester, I started working as a graduate assistant at Auburn's [University Writing](https://www.auburn.edu/academic/provost/university-writing/) initiative. My experiences at Auburn were incredibly impactful: I got to learn the theory and practice of teaching, collaborate with my mentors in exciting research projects, and present at national conferences.

During my master's, I took a few linguistics courses while pursuing an English Language Teaching certificate. These were the most inspiring courses I took in my whole time at Auburn, and it wasn't long before I knew I had to continue my studies in Linguistics. 

After graduating from Auburn in 2020, I worked for two semesters as a Portuguese language tutor at the [Academic Support Program for Student Athletes](https://aspsa.unc.edu/) at UNC-Chapel Hill. This experience allowed me to put in practice many of the concepts I had learned about in my adult education and linguistics courses. 

My current focus is on applying to graduate programs in Linguistics starting this Fall. To support my applications, I have completed several projects, which you can check out in the [Projects]({% link _tabs/projects.md %}) section of this site. Feel free to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lcsadelino) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lucasadelino) for updates on these projects!

When I'm not working, you can likely find me hanging out with my cat Bo, watching TV with wife, gaming, or cooking.
