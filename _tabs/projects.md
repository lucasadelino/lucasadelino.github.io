In preparation for my PhD applications, I have been studying programming, algorithms and data structures, and natural language processing. 

## Natural Language Processing

I have been studying Natural Language Processing through Jurafsky and Martin's (2021) [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). The projects below were created primarily as a way of practicing the concepts I had just learned. Some of these projects were prompted directly by exercises or pseudocode from the textbook, such as the edit distance and n-gram projects, but even in those cases, I try to add more features or a unique spin to the projects.

[Chapter 3 - N-gram Sentence Generator]({% link projects/chapter3.md %}) ([Code](https://github.com/lucasadelino/Learning-Compling/blob/main/Textbooks/Speech%20and%20Language%20Processing%20(Jurafsky%2C%20Martin)/Chapter%203%20-%20N-gram%20Language%20Models/ngram.py))

[Chapter 4 - Naive Bayes Sentiment Classifier]({% link projects/chapter4.md %}) ([Code](https://github.com/lucasadelino/Learning-Compling/tree/main/Textbooks/Speech%20and%20Language%20Processing%20(Jurafsky%2C%20Martin)/Chapter%204%20-%20Naive%20Bayes%20and%20Sentiment%20Classification))

## Site

Here I describe how and why I created this website:
