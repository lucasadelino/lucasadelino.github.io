In preparation for PhD applications, I have been studying natural language processing and algorithms and data structures. To practice the concepts I learn, I created the projects below.

Rather than just having the projects speak for themselves, I felt it was important for me to document _how_ they came to be, something you can't really do just with comments and doc-strings in code. I wanted to show that process in terms of _problem-solving_, so I outlined the major challenges I encountered and how I approached them. Lastly, describing the process was highly beneficial to my learning! As anyone wont to do [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) can tell you, explaining something can make yourself understand it much better.

## Natural Language Processing

I have been studying Natural Language Processing through Jurafsky and Martin's (2021) [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). The projects below were created primarily as a way of practicing the concepts I had just learned. Some of these projects were prompted directly by exercises or pseudocode from the textbook, such as the edit distance and n-gram projects, but even in those cases, I try to add more features or a unique spin to the projects.

## Site

Here's how and why I created this website:
