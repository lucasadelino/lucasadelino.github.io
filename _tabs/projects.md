In preparation for my PhD applications, I have been studying programming, algorithms and data structures, and natural language processing. 

## Natural Language Processing

I have been studying Natural Language Processing through Jurafsky and Martin's (2021) [Speech and Language Processing](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/). The projects below were created primarily as a way of practicing the concepts I had just learned. Some of these projects were prompted directly by exercises or pseudocode from the textbook, such as the edit distance and n-gram projects, but even in those cases, I try to add more features or a unique spin to the projects.
